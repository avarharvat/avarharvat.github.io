            <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon almond flour </li>
            <li>1 cup nonfat plain greek yogurt</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat an air fryer to 325 degrees F    (165 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Line the basket with parchment paper and spray with nonstick cooking spray.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place almond flour, Greek yogurt, 2 tablespoons sweetener, baking powder, cinnamon, vanilla extract, and salt in a bowl and mix well. Use your hands to make dough come together.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Dust working area with flour and separate dough into 4 equal pieces, shape into balls. Cut each ball into 8 equal pieces using a bench scraper. Roll each piece in flour; roll in between your hands into a long, thin rope (the thinner the rope, the crispier they will be). Place all 8 ropes, one by one, in a circular mound into the prepared air fryer basket. Repeat with remaining dough balls. Spray each funnel cake with cooking spray.
            </li>
            <br>

                Air fry until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Flip each funnel cake over, spray with cooking spray, and air fry an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons sweetener.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 lb. russet potatoes, scrubbed clean</li>
            <li>4 tsp. olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>1 tsp. salt, divided</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. ground black pepper, divided</li>
            <li>Nonstick spray</li>
            <li>Ketchup and/or ranch dressing, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <hr>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Cut the potatoes into a french fry shape, about 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick. Place in a large bowl and cover by 1 inch with very hot water. Let sit for 10 minutes, then rinse the potatoes well under cold water. Transfer the potatoes to a sheet tray lined with paper towels and pat very dry.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Place the potatoes in a large mixing bowl (if using the soaking bowl, rinse and dry it well). Drizzle with 2 teaspoons of oil, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper and toss well to coat. Transfer to an air fryer basket sprayed with nonstick spray and distribute evenly. Cook at 360° for 15 minutes, turning with a rubber spatula half-way through and redistributing the fries evenly in the basket. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Return the potatoes to the mixing bowl and gently toss to coat with the remaining 2 teaspoons of oil, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Return the potatoes to the air fryer basket and cook at 400° for 12 more minutes, removing the basket and shaking well half-way through. Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauces, such as ketchup or ranch dressing.
