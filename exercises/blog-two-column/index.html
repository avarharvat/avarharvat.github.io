                        We travel to enquire, to hear stories and to be awestruck by incredible scenery. To witness the ingenuity and defiance of individuals and the remarkable output of their cooperation. To be humbled by the history of yesterday, informed about the politics of today and excited by the possibilities of tomorrow.

                    <h3>WHERE IS APPENZELL?</h3>
                <p>
                    Appenzell is in the northeastern part of Switzerland, 15 kilometres from the Austrian border. It lies at the foot of the Alpstein Mountains in the region of Apenzellerland about 1 hours’ drive from Zurich.It is famous for its eponymously named ‘Appenzeller cheese’ and for the stunning beauty of its countryside.

                    June to the end of September is the best time to visit Appenzell.The summer season in the high Swiss Mountains can be short. Snow often covers the trails on the 4,000m high mountains, and the huts and cable cars can remain closed until July. However, the mountains in Appenzell are not as high, only reaching 2,500m. This means that the summer season can last much longer.The main cable cars are open all year and the mountain huts open from May until October.You might find snow on the higher trails until June or July. Snow can come again in September. However, you can hike many of the lower paths from June to October.Appenzell is also much less busy than its more famous rivals (Zermatt and the Berner Oberland), so even in peak summer, it doesn’t feel too crowded.

                                Beneath a 100m high cliff, this lovely wooden guesthouse perches on a narrow ledge. It seems to almost hang in the air as the dramatic scenery of the Alpstein mountains stretches below. The hut was built 160 years ago by farmers. They needed a place to rest while their goats grazed on the hill. Today, the hut offers accommodation, delicious food and drinks, and a fantastic outdoor mountain terrace. It’s one of the best you’ll find anywhere. The hut is only a 25-minute hike from the top of the Ebenalp Cable Car and the walk can be undertaken by almost anyone.

                                Seealpsee is one of the most beautiful lakes in Switzerland. Sitting at 1143m in altitude, it’s blue-green waters are hemmed in by towering mountains on three sides.

                                There are great views from the Berggasthaus Ebenalp. It’s a short walk from the top of the Ebenalp Cable Car Station. However, the best views in the area are from the Berggasthaus Seealpsee which is at the eastern end of the lake.

                                There are two peaks that dominate the Appenzeller region: Säntis at 2,502 metres and Altmann at 2,432 metres. The sinewy spines of ridges that rise and fall below the peaks is one of the defining features of the Appenzell region.
