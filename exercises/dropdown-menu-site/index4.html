                Hi there! My name is Rex and I am even cuter in person! Car rides, hanging on the couch with my people, going on walks and playing with toys are some of my favorite things. In my previous home I lived with small children and was great with them. In my previous home I lived with smaller dogs and did well. With the proper introduction I could be open to having a best friend! If you are looking for an active, affectionate, and big personality in a little body, I am your boy!
