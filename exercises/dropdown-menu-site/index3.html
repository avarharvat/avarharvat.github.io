But don't let her energy fool you - Violet is also a sweetheart who loves to cuddle up with her favorite humans. With her sweet disposition and loving personality, she's sure to steal your heart in no time. We're hoping to find a new home for her with someone who has the time and energy to give her the love and attention she craves.
