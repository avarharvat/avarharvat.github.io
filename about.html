            I am an aspiring graphic design and web developer. I am a student enrolled in First Institute located in Orlando, Florida. I reside in Bluffton, South Carolina, where I have been living for the last three years. <br>
            <br>
            I have always had a passion for design and a critical eye for details. I always new that I would end up with a career involving design and I have been lucky enough to have the opportunity to refine my craft while at first institute. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I look forward to continuing my education and learning more about what it means to be a designer.
