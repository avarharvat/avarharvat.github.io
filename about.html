                <br>
                I am currently attending FIRST Institute in Orlando, Florida studying graphic design and web development. During my time at FIRST I have had experience working in Adobe Creative such as Illustrator, Photoshop, Xd, and Lightroom. I have also had basic coding experience for website as well as experience in WordPress.
                <br>
                <br>
                While in school I have also worked on projects for a local restaurant, designing their menus and also interning with slingshot inc., a small graphic design company.
